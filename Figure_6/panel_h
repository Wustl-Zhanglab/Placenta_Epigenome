# 1) Calculate scores per genome regions found in "H3K27ac_2ndup_sPEup.bed". 

computeMatrix --reference-point -S 2ndtri.bw 3rdtri.bw 2ndlike_sPE.bw 3rdlike_sPE.bw -o results.npz -R H3K27ac_2ndup_sPEup.bed -a 500 -b 500 -p 32
## "H3K27ac_2ndup.bed" is found in Figure_6 folder

# 2) Plot average pattern of H3K27ac levels within genomic regions

plotHeatmap -m results.npz -out results.pdf

# 5) Combined the graphs into one using Illustrator
