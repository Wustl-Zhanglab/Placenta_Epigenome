## Merge MACS2 peak output

cat peak_file1.bed peak_file2.bed peakfile3.bed > merged_peaks.bed
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n merged_peaks.bed > merged_peaks.bed.sorted
bedtools merge -i merged_peaks.bed.sorted > merged_peaks.bed

## Determine the score of each peak window

bedtools map -a input.w1.cpm-normalized.bed -b merged_peaks.bed -c 4 -o sum
  # repeat this step for all samples

## boxplots were generated using GraphPad Prism7
