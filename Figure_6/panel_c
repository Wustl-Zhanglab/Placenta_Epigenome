## 1) Averaging bigwig files. Perform this for 2nd tri samples, 3rd tri samples, 2nd tri-like sPEs, and 3rd tri-like sPEs

# Merge replicates using bigWigMerge. This will simply generate the sum of all replicates
bigWigMerge B39987*.w50.bamCoverage.bw B39989*.w50.bamCoverage.bw B39991*.w50.bamCoverage.bw B39993*.w50.bamCoverage.bw B39995*.50.bamCoverage.bw new_3rdtri_merged2.bedGraph

# Divide the score by the number of smaples merged to generate average scores
awk  -F "\t" '{print $1, $2, $3, $4/4}' new_3rdtri_merged2.bedGraph > new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bedGraph
  # modify $4/4 according to the sample number. For two samples, $4/2, for five samples, $4/5, etc. 
  
# Sort averaged file
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bedGraph > new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bedGraph.sorted

# Run bedGraphToBigWig to convert bedGraph to Bigwig for visualization
bedGraphToBigWig new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bedGraph.sorted hg19.size bedGraphToBigWig new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bw

# 2) Identification of 2nd trimester-like sPE sites

## Modify H3K27ac_2ndvs3rd_sigdiff.counts.txt from multiBigwigSummary by removing 2nd trimester samples. concat chr, start, and end to make genomic region keys.
## The idea is to identify differentially enriched sites between 3rd and sPE CTBs within H3K27ac_2ndvs3rd_sigdiff.bed genomic regions


x <- read.delim("H3K27ac_2ndvs3rd_sigdiff.counts)
group <- factor(c(1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2)) # 1 = sPEs; 2 = 3rd trimesters
y <- DGEList(counts=x,group=group)
keep <- filterByExpr(y)
design <- model.matrix(~group)
y <- estimateDisp(y,design)
fit <- glmQLFit(y,design)
qlf <- glmQLFTest(fit,coef=2)
res <- topTags(qlf, n = inf )
write.table(res, "output.txt, sep="\t", row.names=TRUE, col.names=TRUE)

##filtered the output.txt by identifying the genomic regions with enrichment in 2nd trimester and sPE and saved a file nmaed "H3K27ac_2ndup_sPEup.bed". This file is found in Figure_6 folder.


## 3) Calculate scores per genome regions found in "H3K27ac_2ndup_sPEup.bed". 

computeMatrix --reference-point -S 2ndtri.bw 3rdtri.bw 2ndlike_sPE.bw 3rdlike_sPE.bw -o results.npz -R H3K27ac_2ndup_sPEup.bed -a 500 -b 500 -p 32
#"H3K27ac_2ndup.bed" is found in Figure_6 folder

## 4) Plot average pattern of H3K27ac levels within genomic regions

plotHeatmap -m results.npz -out results.pdf

## 5) Combined the graphs into one using Illustrator
