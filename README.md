# Genome-scale fluctuations in the cytotrophoblast epigenome over gestation and in placental pathology
---
## Abstract
Beyond hypomethylation of human placental DNA, little is known about the cytotrophoblast and extraembryonic epigenomes, which we profiled during 2nd trimester and at term. These timepoints corresponded to rapid growth and functional decline, respectively. DNA methylation was compartment-specific and, in cytotrophoblasts, increased with advancing gestation age. In all the samples, H3K9me3 overlapped deeply DNA hypomethylated domains with reduced gene expression. As pregnancy advanced, cytotrophoblast DNA exhibited a relative loss of common histone modifications, including H3K27ac. Cytotrophoblast mRNAs downregulated at term were enriched in genes upregulated in severe preeclampsia. Immunoanalyses of cytotrophoblasts from these cases revealed strongly enhanced H3K27ac signals. ChIP-seq of the cells showed sPE was associated with enhanced H3K27ac peaks at numerous unique sites relative to control 2nd trimester or term cytotrophoblasts, including genes upregulated in this syndrome. Thus, significant shifts in the cytotrophoblast epigenome occurred over the placentaâ€™s compressed lifespan, with H3K27ac contributing to dysregulated gene expression in a placenta-associated pregnancy complication.
