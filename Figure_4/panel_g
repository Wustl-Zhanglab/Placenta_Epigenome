## 1) Averaging bigwig files

# Merge replicates using bigWigMerge. This will simply generate the sum of all replicates
bigWigMerge B39987*.w50.bamCoverage.bw B39989*.w50.bamCoverage.bw B39991*.w50.bamCoverage.bw B39993*.w50.bamCoverage.bw B39995*.50.bamCoverage.bw new_3rdtri_merged2.bedGraph

# Divide the score by the number of smaples merged to generate average scores
awk  -F "\t" '{print $1, $2, $3, $4/4}' new_3rdtri_merged2.bedGraph > new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bedGraph
  # modify $4/4 according to the sample number. For two samples, $4/2, for five samples, $4/5, etc. 
  
# Sort averaged file
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bedGraph > new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bedGraph.sorted

# Run bedGraphToBigWig to convert bedGraph to Bigwig for visualization
bedGraphToBigWig new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bedGraph.sorted hg19.size bedGraphToBigWig new_3rdtri_merged2.average.bw
